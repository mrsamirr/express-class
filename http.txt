Things to do with Node -> Create HTTP servers*****
                       -> Create command line interface(CLI), games, etc...

** HTTP server(hyper-text transfer protocol) ** 

-> protocal/instruction defined for machine to communicate.
-> for web, most common way the Frontend talk to its Backend.(using request and response protocals)

HTTP server -> some code that follows the HTTP protocal and is able to communicate with clients

||  HTTP protocals  ||
-> the client throws some info at the server -> server does something with that info -> server responds with final result...

-> Arguments : something the client sends
-> instead calling a function by its name,the client uses a URL(Uniform Resource Locator.)
-> instead of a function body,the server does something with that request(from client)
-> instead of function returning a value, the server responds with some data...

while making HTTP server client needs to think about -:
1. Protocol(HTTP/HTTPS)
2. Address(URL/IP/Port)
3. Route
4. Header,Body,Query Parameters 
5. Method

things that server needs to worry about -:
1. Response Header
2. Response Body
3. Status Codes

HTTP(client side) -: eg : https://www.google.com/wikipedia/india

https:// -> Protocol
www.google.com -> URL
wikipedia/india -> Route

Header -> cookie(Authorization in inspect element)
Body -> Request provided 
Method -> [POST/GET/etc...]

HTTP(server side)
1. Response header 
2. Response body -> result of your argument/question
3. Status Code -> of the request(like ERROR:404)

What happens when we search something in a browser(Interview question)****
-> Browser passes the URL
-> Does a DNS loop(converts google.com to an IP) // IP-> how to specify diffrent servers from each other
 -- DNS -> domain name service --(used to find servers via domains as IP is very hard to find)
-> Establishes a connection to an IP.

Common Request -> [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]

Status Codes -: 
200 -> everything is OK
403 -> Authentication issue
404 -> Page/Route not exist
411 -> wrong input and incorrect operation
500 -> Internal Server ERROR


HTTP Protocol 
-> Library to be used : ExpressJS

Request types -: 
(eg : when you are going for a doctor visit for organ-transplant)
1. GET - going for consultation to get a checkup
2. POST - going to get a new kidney inserted
3. PUT - going to get a kidney replaced
4. DELETE - going to get a kidney removed
